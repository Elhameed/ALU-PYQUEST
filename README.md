<h1 align="center">ALU-PYQUEST</h1>

## Summary
So far, we've made great progress on our ALU-PYQUEST project. We've defined the game's rules, created a welcome message, and set up a range of questions for each level. We've also created a function that generates a random set of questions. However, we still have a few key features to implement, such as user input and output functions, a scoring system, and finalizing the user interface design. We're feeling positive about our progress so far, and we're confident that we'll be able to complete the project on time as long as we can overcome any challenges that may arise during development.

## Achievements
We have completed the first few features of our ALU PyQuest project, including setting the rules and guidelines of the game and generating a set of random questions from beginner to advanced levels. Users can interact with the game by answering each question within 25 seconds, earning 10 points for each correct answer and losing 5 points for incorrect answers or running out of time. The playgame() function has been defined to initiate the game and prompt the user if they are ready to start. We still need to implement the actual question-and-answer interface, display the score after the game, and provide an option to restart or exit. Overall, we are on track to complete the project on time, but there are still some challenges ahead in implementing these remaining features.

## Challenges
There are no challenges faced. 

## Next Steps
Based on the current achievements of this project, We will focus on implementing the remaining features of the game, including the logic for keeping track of time, displaying the questions, accepting user input, checking the answers, and keeping track of scores. We will also incorporate error handling to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior during gameplay. Furthermore, We will test the game thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and make necessary improvements based on feedback. We will also work on the user interface to make it more appealing and user-friendly. Finally, We will ensure the code is well-documented and organized and adhere to best practices to facilitate maintenance and future updates.
