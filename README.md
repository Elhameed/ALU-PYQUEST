## Summary
So far, we've made great progress on our ALU-PYQUEST project. We've defined the game's rules, created a welcome message, and set up a range of questions for each level. We've also created a function that generates a random set of questions. However, we still have a few key features to implement, such as user input and output functions, a scoring system, and finalizing the user interface design. We're feeling positive about our progress so far, and we're confident that we'll be able to complete the project on time as long as we can overcome any challenges that may arise during development.
