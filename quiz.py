Welcome to ALU PyQuest!

The goal of this game is to test your knowledge of Python programming language.

You will be presented with a series of questions related to the Python curriculum. The questions will be presented one at a time, starting from beginner's level to advanced level, and you will have a limited time to answer each question.

For each correct answer, you will earn 10 points, and for each incorrect answer or if you run out of time, 5 points will be deducted from your score. You will have 25 seconds for each question.

At the end of the game, your total score will be displayed. Good luck!
